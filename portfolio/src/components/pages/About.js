      As a seasoned Manager in Social Services with years of experience leading teams and managing 
      complex projects, I am now pursuing a new career path in Web Development. With a strong foundation in leadership, 
      strategic planning, and problem-solving. I have completed a rigorous Web Development Bootcamp through the 
      University of Toronto. This immersive program provided me with a solid understanding of full-stack web development, 
      including front-end development with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as back-end development with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.
      Through individual and team projects, I gained practical experience developing responsive and dynamic websites and web applications. 
      The skills and knowledge I gained from this program have prepared me well for a successful transition to a career in Web Development.
